Has long charge. Phone finder,  phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display, display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.,Just bought it ,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good,It was a awesome watch... I liked it sleep monitoring it's accurate. According to me this worth buying and I would suggest anyone who is reading this review to go ahead and buy this watch,It's good product in this range because I have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt it's better. Only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting time.,I liked Everything except Hearbeat and O2 Level accuracy but it's close to real levels so average in this respect. Otherwise it's a kill for the money !!! Very good overall.,The product is good as per the price charged. One feedback to supplier to improve the glass of watch, there are lots of scratches within one month of usage.\",\n          \"The earphones have good clear sound quality. It lacks base. Battery backup is good. ANC is a myth in this earphone. It might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,Eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. Over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,Bought this solely due to its form factor - to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. To be true Samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique TWS.This is not an inear style TWS but resembles somewhat earbud style TWS, only of its kind in the market as far as my Knowledge goes.They are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out (strange as I can't use earbuds because they fall out frequently). It seems that Samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. However, it doesn't mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.The finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch.  The size of the buds and the case is very small.Now about the sound. If the buds fit in one's ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.The sound signature is very bassy for my taste and I have to eq it to my taste. The bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. I listen it in TREBLE BOOST mode adjusted through the app. ANC works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. In contrary, ANC ON somewhat opens up the sound. Don't buy this for ANC.Strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iPhone 12mini than my Galaxy S22 (Spotify and Apple Music). The buds have app support for both Android (Galaxy wear) and iOS (Galaxy Buds Live) but the Android app is more feature packed and works better.  The iOS app couldn't update the firmware (although there is a Menu in the app) and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. However,  as soon as I connected with my S22, on pairing,  the first thing it did was to update the firmware.I love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4K against an MRP of 16K. The do sound very good but does not suit my taste.  Persons loving bass may love them. Don't get them for ANC. Battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. It has wireless charging too. If your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,Best call quality. Noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.Descent battery life.Music is good. Not to that top notch, but good in this segment.Overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,I am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,Bluetooth range is not that good,The sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. I got these for Rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until I faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. The bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. It feels like I am using bluetooth v3.0. The range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. The mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. I think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone's quality. If you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. Samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. I pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. Even at Rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue.
